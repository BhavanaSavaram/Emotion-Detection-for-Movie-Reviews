 Only the park outside of the hotel was beautiful 
 No real complaints the hotel was great great location surroundings rooms amenities and service Two recommendations however firstly the staff upon check in are very confusing regarding deposit payments and the staff offer you upon checkout to refund your original payment and you can make a new one Bit confusing Secondly the on site restaurant is a bit lacking very well thought out and excellent quality food for anyone of a vegetarian or vegan background but even a wrap or toasted sandwich option would be great Aside from those minor minor things fantastic spot and will be back when i return to Amsterdam 
 Location was good and staff were ok It is cute hotel the breakfast range is nice Will go back 
 Great location in nice surroundings the bar and restaurant are nice and have a lovely outdoor area The building also has quite some character 
 Amazing location and building Romantic setting 
 Good restaurant with modern design great chill out place Great park nearby the hotel and awesome main stairs 
 The room is spacious and bright The hotel is located in a quiet and beautiful park 
 Good location Set in a lovely park friendly staff Food high quality We Oth enjoyed the breakfast 
It is the best place that I have stayed so far.
 The room was big enough and the bed is good The breakfast food and service on the hotel is good outside the hotel there is a big park which is very good for walk in the morning and evening Many people are having picnics and do some bicycling 
 Rooms were stunningly decorated and really spacious in the top of the building Pictures are of room 300 The true beauty of the building has been kept but modernised brilliantly Also the bath was lovely and big and inviting Great more for couples Restaurant menu was a bit pricey but there were loads of little eatery places nearby within walking distance and the tram stop into the centre was about a 6 minute walk away and only about 3 or 4 stops from the centre of Amsterdam Would recommend this hotel to anyone it s unbelievably well priced too 
 Style location rooms
 Comfy bed good location 
 This hotel is being renovated with great care and with an appreciation for its unique structure and location My spacious and comfortable room had a large double paned glass window onto the lush greenery of the park The breakfast selection was spectacular All considered this was a great hotel for the price and I plan to return 
 It was very good very historic building that s why I chose it 
 This hotel is awesome I took it sincirely because a bit cheaper but the structure seem in an hold church close to one awesome park Arrive in the city are like 10 minutes by tram and is super easy The hotel inside is awesome and really cool and the room is incredible nice with two floor and up one super big comfortable room I ll come back for sure there The staff very gentle one Spanish man really really good 
 Great onsite cafe Amazing building Park location Amazing Bobby Gin and Tonic 
 We loved the location of this hotel The fact that it is set in a Park away from the busy centre of dam square was great The tram system was brilliant and easy to handle The hotel is lovely and the bed was comfy Staff were very friendly and helpful and familiarized themselves with us when they realized we travelled from Ireland 
 Public areas are lovely and the room was nice but the window was broken and the drains in the bathroom smelt Its an old building and clearly has old building issues 
 I liked the hotels history And for such an enormous hotel I can t imagine how many girls were orphaned I liked their breakfast It was a quirky mix of fruits pastries meats and fish breads and the regular bacon and eggs Juices tea and coffee 
 Friendly staff OostPark a few yards away Good continental breakfast selection Quiet and relaxing area 
 The breakfast was the only positive element of this hotel original in taste and a good selection of selection of health food dishes on the buffet We did not try the restaurant but the whole set up with its view and terrace on the park is exceptional We had a wedding in the hotel s chapel so the convenience of just walking upstairs after the party was our reason of selecting this location 
 The location is good You need 15min to 20min walk to the center depends on your speed The hotel locates in a beautiful park and have a nice interior design The bed was really comfortable 
 Bed was extremely comfy and the staff where well spoken they also gave us all the help with easiest way to city centre and all the relevant transportation tickets and unique locations to visit will definitely be returning as this city is beautiful and the people are so friendly 
 Lovely hotel with extremely comfortable huge double bed We stayed in the split level room which we really liked If you have difficulty getting up stairs request if you can stay in a room all on one level The Oosterpark is beautiful the shops and restaurants are great with lots of variety to choose from You can get the Metro close by 8min walk or the Tram is a short walk away and runs from the station and you can get off within a 5 mins walk to the Hotel All in all a beautiful hotel with friendly staff shampoo and soap in the shower Tea and coffee facilities in your room and in a location that is more relaxing than the central Amsterdam We will be returning 
 Great location in the park near museums and restaurants Perfect launch pad for many walking and day trips Beautiful old building former orphanage and spacious rooms Big breakfast spread perfect for starting the day off right Friendly and helpful staff I m
 The Hotel itself is in a lovely location a 5min if that tram ride into the center Train right outside the Hotel easy access to everywhere The Staff are super friendly and always on hand to help and advice Wonderful bright comfortable and clean rooms Beds are amazing felt as if we were sleeping on clouds Bathroom was clean spacious and airy We had Shampoo Body wash there alongside hair dryer towels safe wardrobe hangers clothes holders desk chair room service hair dryer fridge kettle and cups teas and coffees It literally has everything you need in the room Perfect Hotel couldn t fault it at all The lovely smell from the restaurant downstairs is great Tennis court outside the Hotel little pond as well and a huge park to walk around 
 Great hotel original concept style
 The hotel itself is beautiful restaurant is very good and the adjacent park is gorgeous with beautiful birds and rabbits 
 The hotel is located in a beautiful old monastery building which has a special mood combined with all modern features There is a big park just opposite to the hotel Public transportation and a nice bakery for breakfast are also close Good wifi all around the hotel 
 The staff were so friendly and helpful plus the bar restaurant area is beautiful Located in its own park and the old building is simply stunning 
 Friendly staff The bar restaurant area is lovely and overlooks the park Very modern 
It is the best place that I have stayed so far.
 The hotel is going through renovations and unfortunately it means that the rooms can be less than perfect However the staff did recognise those shortcomings and did everything they could to make the stay as agreeable as possible 
 The room was very big spacious The bath tub was large enough for two people I love the axcess to the from multiple trams and trains The park location was amazing
 Very nice hotel manager he upgraded us because we had troubles with two different rooms They do everything to make you feel welcome and comfortable The park directly in front of the hotel is amazing rent a bike directly and make a tour Also the bathtub and bed is great 
 the building meeting rooms modern style of my room park
 Very nice hotel located in a park Ca 30 minutes by walk to the city center Not typical for Amsterdam since most city hotels are located in small buildings But pay attention to the fact that most of the rooms are two storeyed so you will have to use stairs to get to bed 
 The location was amazing the room was fantastic east access to public transport set on the lovely Oosterpark lots of places to eat and drink near by or nice walk to the main areas of Amsterdam I would definitely like to stay here again I only had breakfast at the restaurant on site and this was only once and fairly standard as A brit and a connoisseur of cooked breakfasts I was a little disappointed in the hot food but generally lots on offer for everyone just no where does a cooked breakfast like the English but very helpful staff and a nice place to sit with a coffee and start the day and this is the least of any worries due to their being so many good places to eat around and I personally prefer to wander and explore for my dining experiences But not qualified to give a true opinion of the restaurant it was certainly busy in the evenings which suggests its pretty good I will definitely be staying there again if possible the next time i take a trip to Amsterdam
 Location on the park with easy access to tram lines was very good 
 The hotel is nicely localted directly within the park which is accessed when walking out of the building The building itself has great history and wonderful architecture The staff is very helpful and friendly when in need of anything 
 Nice restaurant although felt breakfast was rather expensive at 17 50 per head Location as expected but with hind sight a little further from the main tourist areas than we might have liked but was quite nice to be out of the noisy city centre Staff very courteous 
 Love the design of the renovated product The park nearby for a walk 
 Staff were amazing very very friendly and proud of the place they work in The cafe is very cool Will be back
 The brunch to purchase in the morning was good 
 The location of the hotel is super opening out to Oosterpark The staff was very helpful and friendly The bed was very comfortable The room was spacious enough for 2 people 
 Massive bed
 The hotel looks really impressive Set in a beautiful location The room was clean well decorated and the bed was one of the most comfortable I d ever slept in 
 The quality of the hotel was brilliant and even though it was under renovation there was no disruption or noise The location of the hotel is far enough away from the centre of the city that it did not feel like a tourist trap and it is also situated in a fantastic park near some great bars and restaurants I cannot fault the staff facilities or the price and would highly recommend this to anyone 
 clean and new
 My room was upgraded because they are doing renovations in part of the building The room I was given was enormous and very comfortable I wish I had been staying for a week not just one night 
 The location and views 
 The location in a quiet park with a great terrace The space and the rooms are exquisite with a lot of taste The gigantic beds pillows and bedsheets are super comfortable It s dark and silent which is something impossible to find in Amsterdam Staff was very friendly and accommodating The restaurant with a view over the park is great to work and eat
 Beautiful setting in a lovely park room very spacious clean and comfortable bar area looking over the park was stunning located on the peaceful outskirts of the city but very easy to travel around on the tram system old building with a modern refurbishment it suited us perfectly
 good and comfortable mattress near tram station helpful people from recepction
 The hotel is lovely and the staff were amazing They even sorted out booking a meal and taxi for me when I emailed them about this when I first booked online This was such a good idea as we found out after that it was one of the best in town It is set in a park and just looks amazing from the outside and inside is top draw too I would highly recommend 
 location in the park Cool interior design comfy bed 
 Location was good but needed tram subway to get to centre of Amsterdam Room was nice but stairs were hard to get up and down to get to bed at night room was clean hotel was nice and modern located in next a lovely park staff were friendly 
 The location was perfect and so beautiful Only a tram ride from the centre anywhere really 
 Basically everything The style of the hotel is really great The breakfast is really good good quality food really really nice coffe order from the bar The wifi was good in my room and also throuout the hotel The location is near a metro station its easy to get to the center I loved this hotel honestly and i will stay here again for sure The staff cares that you have a good stay i really liked that Thumbs up from me 
 The property is beautiful
 Most of the thing we experience is a very good just keep it up
 I d booked the trip as a surprise for my partners birthday We got a free room upgrade upon arrival and balloons delivery to the room by the front of house staff to wish him a happy birthday Great staff very welcoming friendly and helpful Lovely room very comfy bed 
 Location is good They gave me some freebies for noisy room
 The hotel was fantastic in a lovely setting of a park The hotel itself has been decorated to a very good standard 
 Great trip staff very friendly
 Nice open room Bed plenty of room Bath room clean Fridge was a nice touch Easy to get in and out Staff accommodated us fast and politely
 To begin with we were upgraded which made my wife very happy the room was spacious and warm with minimal noise Breakfast has improved hotel was well looked after It has undergone some major renovations since I last stayed there The new wing looks beautiful and the company has invested a lot into the property Super impressed with the Park and the way nature comes together with the hotel New dining area is magnificent and all food looked fantastic we preferred to eat out for dinner because of sight seeing 
 Beautiful design comfortable room friendly staff Quick tram to leidseplein and Metro to central 
 The bath and shower room was amazing Beautiful hotel They are going through a refebishment at the moment and I am looking forward to when it is complete to see the final look which I think will look even more stunning then the building is already
 The building was fantastic All renovated areas were very stylish The receptionist was very friendly and gave us a warm start in this place 
 The young guy at the reception was really friendly and helpful Dinner has been cooked excellent 
 The location is really good the room was spacious and comfortable the bathroom as well 
 breakfast on first day bacon ran out new batch was undercooked and not very hot limited choice of cereal and bread next day much improved more cereal yogurt and cooked tomatoes added 
 Lovely hotel with lots of history Great food in the restaurant and a very comfy bed
 The whole hotel was very clean the staff were very healpful and friendly The dinning area is very modern and relaxing the rest of the hotel has hints of age to it but it works really well The room was exactly how the pictures looked very clean comfy and modern would definitely stay again 
 The location on the park is excellent and very peaceful The restaurant cafe in the lobby is a wonderful environment and they make excellent coffee 
 Funky rooms well designed hotel friendly and helpful staff comfy bed 
 Hotel was really nice staff were very friendly and helpful I requested a split level room which they gave me when I arrived The room it self was extremely nice and clean and the bed was very comfy The hotel is not in the centre however is a walkable distance or easily got to by the Metro Would definitely recommend this hotel and will be returning 
 We have stayed here a few times and always enjoyed the fab rooms There are renovations going on that have just made the place extra special Our room 065 was just gorgeous 
 The location is beautiful I m sure after the renovations this will be a lovely hotel 
 Beautiful room that was ready early with the most comfortable massive bed Backs straight onto the park can t wait to come back when all of the construction is complete We didn t hear anything building work related whilst staying Loved the atmosphere and feeling of all the areas of the hotel Especially the hall to our room 
 We like the building although still under construction it has a nice atmosphere Of course location is perfect near the city centre and the parc 
 The room was lovely great hotel beautiful location 
 The restaurant opened 2 days before however the food was good especially the burger Good breakfast with fresh orange juice WIFI in all hotel
 Beautiful restaurant with great food and a lovely park to look over quirky and grand in design with relaxing rooms Staff a very helpful and chatty It s a unique place once completed its going to be a fabulous venue we are keen to return in the summer
 The bed was really comfortable and loved the style of the hotel room bed upstairs bathroom modern and lots of glass and gloss The food was absolutely gorgeous 
 Pretty building interesting rooms 
 Room changed quickly when we had to complain about the cold and strong smell of new paint Free drink card to make up for renovations inconveniences 
 rooms were large and modern and hotel was not a normal chain A lot more interesting and quirky
 Large bed 
 It s a beautiful hotel or should I say will be when the renovation is finished 
 Good location Cheap 
 Anyways the staff was extremely friendly no complants there Location of the hotel is about 1km from the nearest metro station The rooms were tidy and the beds were good to sleep in However there where several small faulty details unfinished renovation in the room like lamp on the floor nails sticking out of floor which rips your sock etc so nothing major but adding them all together it makes this as a three star hotel in my opinnion 
 Beautifull buiding next to Oosterpark Friendly staff Great breakfast 
 Great room very comfortable bed Nice and quiet Fantastic decor and amazing staircases The location is great if you want to avoid the hectic nature of the city centre and red light district but can be walked in around half an hour The immediate area is fantastic great Park amazing local restaurants frequented by locals etc one of which has the largest selection of beer available Near by brewery that do tours not Heineken and great beer Good museum near by and even a local coffeeshop that we better value than those in the center 
 We upgraded to a larger room Had the bath infront of the bed which allowed us to relax before having the best nights sleep I ve probably ever had due to the comfort of the beds 
 A very quirky hotel that managed to keep its identy despite moderisation situated in a lovely location Bed was extrememly comfortable and cleanliness of hotel was outstanding 
It is the best place that I have stayed so far.
 beautiful surroundings great location Old world style of the hotel is really different
 Location
 Location was ok and has access to all the public transport a very pleasant park is situated next good for a jogger or just a stroll 
 The bed was amazing Actually our whole room large room The park burger at the restaurant downstairs was also heaven 
 super comfy beds cozy rooms lovely staff pretty sweet location I love amsterdam 
 Staff were brilliant Really helpful attentive and friendly Amazing building with lots of history too 
 Great Customer Service Staff very responsive to our individual needs also helpful in giving directions getting tickets and Metro passes 
 The rooms were comfortable and clean and the bed accommodated sleep well Restaurant and bar staff were very helpful and friendly The breakfast was quite good where there was a variety of selections available to choose from 
 Good water pressure in shower
 The hotel is located in a very nice area of Amsterdam There are museums parks shops and restaurants around as well as many tram stops that can take you everywhere in the city Staff were very kind 
 We upgraded our room had a huge room with a large bath tub 
 Vibe is good location good and historic building is will be beautiful
 Generally clean and interestingly designed But a little worn Meanwhile there is massive renovation underway which will probably make it a much nicer hotel but in the meantime you will walk up a wooden ramp to reception and many amenities are in process The reason to stay here is that it s cheaper than other similar properties possibly because it s in renovation and also because it is off the beaten path though not in a bad neighborhood just not close to the hot spots 
 Architecturally the building is terrific you can feel the history of the place which just isn t there with purpose built chain hotels The Arena has the look and feel of a boutique hotel lushly decorated wrought iron work on staircases chandeliers the up lighting and high windows and ceilings gives a great sense of space Location is fab in the green space of Oosterpark but only a ten min walk to the City Halls The rooms are quirky with a small footprint THe ground level has a closet small sofa WC and shower fridge table and chair with the huge bed on a mezzanine level There s a tv on each level 
 Breakfast was very nice and the staff were so helpful especially with giving us advice on transport around the city Also the bed was comfortable so we slept so well each night 
 This hotel was great value for money Only a few tram stops away from the city centre It was close enough for all the attractions of Amsterdam but far enough away that it was a quiet neighbourhood The zoo is literally a 10 minute walk away or one tram stop Very accessible The room was extremely nice and the bed was outstandingly comfy best nights sleep I ve ever had I would highly recommend this hotel 
 Very friendly staff lovely comfy room
 food recommendations were brilliant
 The inside of the hotel is very classy He staff are friendly and helpful Our room was great Huge bathroom with double sinks and showers small sitting room with a kettle and fridge beautiful bedroom with a big comfortable bed The hotel is a nice area There is a big park next door and it is only a 20 minute walk to the Heineken Experience 
 Bed was really comfy and we had a canal view which was nice to wake up to The hotel was warm and beautifully decorated We were given a free drink voucher to compensate for construction which was really nice
 The location of this hotel is great It s very close to the tram lines and subway The staff was very helpful in getting us a room that was to our liking The breakfast buffet was fine 
 Breakfast was plentiful although often cold when meant to be hot bacon sausage etc Next to park which makes for a pleasant evening walk and tram services nearby Staff very friendly willing to help 
It is the best place that I have stayed so far.
 Well located if you don t mind taking the train 
 this beautiful building has huge potential but you get the feeling that while the extention work is going on the hotel is less of a priority It is starting to look frayed at the edges But there is a good and funky atmosphere and the breakfast was very good The location was also perfect for us as we were visiting relatives nearby and it is also a quite airy part of amsterdam 
 Liked the staff The location
 Special ambience of old convent and medical institution converted into a modern style hotel Relaxed atmosphere Nice restaurant and bar area with terasse Good accessibility of public transport 
 Room was a great size and comfy bed
 The staff were lovely and very helpful Bar and restaurant very good not far from all attractions very good tram links 
 There was a lot of variety at breakfast and the fresh baked croissants were excellent The snacks in the restaurant were also very good The staff at the front desk was cheerful and helpful The bed was comfy 
 Bed was comfy with duck feather duvet and pillows We stayed in a deluxe split room and it was very nice Reception staff bar staff was friendly and helpful 
 Very helpful and friendly staff Free WiFi Location and proximity to public transport Provision of iron and board 2 televisions
 The hotel has its own character and a long history Very cool vibe We got a round of free drinks as consolation to the construction work outside 
 Good breakfast nice beds nice to live at a hotel with history 
 Comfy beds we upgraded to a suite which was very spacious with a bath staff lovely all speak English restaurant food exceptional and great choice at breakfast Tram stops right outside and next to a lovely park
It is the best place that I have stayed so far.
 The friendly staff in bar restaurant The evening meal was excellent A pity the club sandwiches at lunch were awful After the building renovations I think this hotel will be fabulous It has so much history and is so unusual Loved it 
 The staff were very friendly and helpful and our room was amazing the bed was really big and so comfy 
 Great room great staff great food 
 Food in restaurant Quirky place use to be a hospital Reasonably convienent for transport into city centre Beautiful park beside hotel Walk through to other side for some nice cafe basrs for breakfast 
 Beds were comfy the bar staff and reception staff were very helpful when we asked to move rooms
 Beautiful gothic hotel Very good location Some nice bars and restaurants Fabulous Thai restaurant 5 minutes away 3 metro stops from Dam centre Really enjoyed staying there There was building work ongoing but you would never have know 
 The whole experience was amazing there were construction works going on but the staff made sure it didn t impact your time there at all very friendly and very helpful
 Room was lovely we got a free upgrade Bathroom fab Excellent breakfast Nice sitting out area for those who wished to smoke Reception and dining bar staff exceptionally nice 
 Quiet location and thankfully the construction to the exterior of the hotel did not impact our stay

It is the best place that I have stayed so far.
 The bed was huge and comfortable Massively high ceilings and the feature staircase 
 Staff were very friendly helpful The kitchen provided us a great meal the bar staff were nice and the breakfast bar was very impressive 
 The style of the room was unique and amazing with a light room laminate floors and a stunning black bathroom Our kingsize was very comfy and spacious The hotel itself is very beautiful and they have kept the original staircases and high ceilings All of the staff spoke English perfectly just like most people in the city and I couldn t fault them on anything they were always willing to answer our questions and even gave us a map and told us where we could find some interesting places Hotel Arena s location is pretty perfect as it is less than a 10 minute walk from a tram stop to Centraal Dam Square Rembrandtplein and any other places you might be interested in exploring It s also right next to Oosterpark so I can imagine how nice it would be to go to in the spring and upcoming summer Really loved this place overall and a great hotel to stay at especially if it is your first time in Amsterdam as it was mine 
 Location was great for us as was close to my sister there was always someone on the desk the bars were lovely the building was impressive but building work going on which we didn t know about but I m sure it will look amazing Really funky room 
 The bed was super cosy The staff was nice The hotel isn t central but if you get bikes it s very close and easy to cycle 
 Staff were fantastic and changed our overall view of the hotel Got off to a bad start room 240 was tiny and they changed us No argument Bar staff and reception staff really friendly and pleasant 
 Cool hotel great receptionist who gave us ideas of what to do in Amsterdam delicious supper at the hotel And great shower 
 Bar and restraint staff were great reception was a bit lacklustre Also th bathroom walls are completely see through Wouldn t advise number 2 s if you are sharing a room 
 The staff was very nice and friendly the size of the room was really great and the style of the hotel is also very nice The bed was quite confortable 
 Average good accommodation Big room Helpful staff Room cleaned daily Big hot shower Comfy bed 
 The only good thing about this hotel is the friendly staff and the way it looks Considering they have work going on Location is great 5mins walk to tram stop n your in damn square in 10mins Also we bought 3 day travel ticket from the train station for 25 euros n the hotel sell this for 17 50 euros so buy from hotel it s cheaper Trains are not included in the hotel travel card but u won t need trains if your staying in dam Only to and from airport 
 The place looked amazing and it was close enough to everything that walking was not a hassle
 Bed was nice 
 Really nice building but lots of building work going off But only outside so not a problem Good size rooms fairly modern Good location away from the center but easy to get to by tram WiFi worked perfectly and quickly 
 Loved the decor in the hotel and the staff where very helpful and friendly
 24 reception Changed rooms immediately after complaint

 Cool hotel nice feel really comfy beds staff couldn t do enough for you
 The room was exactly as expected The bed was the most comfortable bed that we have ever slept on the shower was HUGE Easy check in and check out only a 5 minute walk to the grocery store staff were very friendly and public transport is only minutes walk from the hotel room or if you like walking everything you need to see is only a 30 45min walk

 The hotel is amazing Beautiful interior We weren t disrupted by the work going on as the place is sound proof Our room was fantastic the only thing I should have done was ask for a fan at reception because the room temperature was too hot and the air con wouldn t go below 21oc The room layout with the bedroom upstairs was lush 
 Room service good quality staff

 Polite staff 
 The staff we encountered were absolutely delightful and very helpful The rooms were clean stylish and comfortable The hotel was conveniently located within walking distance of the centre of Amsterdam 
 nothing
 Staff was vey pleasant The place is very well designed
 Location is good it takes 20 mins by feet and 10 15 mins by tram to get to the city center 
 The room was stunning Did not expect the quality standard received after having to walk past a building site and enter through a dodgy back door Will definitely recommend 
 Very smart room good food 
 Breakfast Staff
 staff helpful but maybe because of building upheaval hotel history and architecture a real treat would stay again try another room and see the hotel when fully refurbished possibly have a discount due to the visit being in middle of a bulding site and not as expected when booked 
 The hall
 Nice staff good rooms with separate little living room and bedroom did not experience any problems with the reconstruction 
 Staff were really friendly 24hour front desk beautiful hotel the room I stayed in double deluxe was amazing lots of restaurants nearby for good food And easy trams into central 10 mins I highly recommend 
 Very beautiful building cozy room cool bar 
 Staff were very friendly on arrival we were upgraded on arrival fantastic room with lovely no fern decor there was works going on outside the hotel but we never heard a thing and it didn t make a difference would definable return to the hotel arena
 Close to Tram Excellent room nice staff 
It is the best place that I have stayed so far.
 Good Wi fi 
 Good location next to the tram but is under going a major revamp No noise problem but the lovely garden is gone Sill good value for money This is a big place lovely old building 
 The best thing at this price excellent price in relation to the modern and spacious room received 
 Character of the hotel was great Location was good
 Hotel and rooms were beautiful My friend and I wanted some luxury on our trip to Amsterdam and this hotel provided just that The staff were extremely friendly and gave us lots of advice on where to go local life etc You will need to get trams metro from this hotel which all added to the experience of our trip Would definitely recommend this hotel 
 The staff were extremely polite and helpful i honestly couldn t fault them The room itself was clean and comfortable and the location was great 
It is the best place that I have stayed so far.
 friendly staff place is very clean and charming beautiful restaurant and bar food looked I didn t try it way better than the usual Amsterdam culinary sins
 This was our first time in Amsterdam and the staff were incredibly helpful They took special notice of the fact that is was my birthday and were so friendly 
 Great location lovely room
 Very nice property stylish hotel friendly staff spacious rooms except the one with stairs and close to the city center just a couple of stops by tram 
 Boutique atmosphere good size rooms with comfortable beds and stylishly designed bathrooms 
 It was a well kept hotel in a lovely area The staff and services offered were excellent We felt it was a great value Our beautiful room with a view was a bonus 
 The hotel is beautiful the pictures here arent doing it justice at all right on Oosterpark which is awesome The location is great walking distance to the tram public transport to anywhere and 5 10 mins to POI convenience shops and small local bars on the quieter part of the city You can also get to the city center by walking but it will take about 20 30mins Very clean room made and towels changed everyday Almost perfect 
 Crews being nice and helpful Environment quiet and peaceful but unfortunately certain areas under construction 
 The bathroom and sofa are so good The building style is really awesome 
 We liked the location and the extra pleasant staff They were very accommodating to our requests e g extra towels and specialty pillows 
 I loved the hotel design and decoration Staff were extremely nice always helpful and smiling That is something you really appreciate when you are on a 24 hour business trip Breakfast was way better than I expected although coffee was quite bad That is something most hotels fail to nail and I think most guests find it important Rooms are fantastically cozy clean and comfortable 
 The bed was comfy and large The wifi was fast and good Separate living area Powerful shower
 Got in late and hadn t eaten 24 hour pizza delivery offered at front desk brilliant at 12pm friendly staff and wifi in room hotel is 15 mins walk from dam square nice to be away from the hussle and bussle in town 
 We stayed at the hotel for 5 nights Hotel is a bit far from the center but with the tram and metro you arrive at the center in minutes Hotel is situated in a quite area The rooms are very spacious comfortable and cosy The staff is very nice and helpful
 Really enjoyed our stay at hotel arena staff were fab made us feel really welcome even made us a coffee at 6am whilst waiting fir our taxi to the airport
 The matress and pillows were exceptionally good Best sleep in terms of comfort ever I would be grateful to know your suppliers as would like to replicate this comfort in my own home 
 Although the hotel is a little from the main centre the hotel itself was outstanding The hotel is currently under construction and expanding its capacity and restaurant bar space I was shocked when we arrived to see a construction site but you couldn t hear any building work from the room and the hotel was impeccable inside Fantastic value for money but I assume once the construction has been completed the hotel will be one of the top places to stay in Amsterdam The bar and restaurant is an added bonus to the hotel and the staff were pleasant and polite The hotel is spectacular and the rooms are modern and very comfortable the previous reviews regarding the bathroom walls are true but we didn t find that an issue I would certainly recommend this hotel to anyone especially for the location as many trams lead to the centre of Amsterdam in only 7 10 minutes

 The staff was very friendly and helpful in organizing our daytime activities Hotel located in a quiet area but very close to subway and restaurants 
 We stayed at the hotel at a friend s recommendation It has great access to public transport and plenty of shops and places to eat close by Laundrette around the corner is also a bonus for long term travellers who need to freshen things up having access to the back garden was an added bonus for lovely summer evenings Would definitely stay there again 
 Super location on Division underground line direct to Heathrow and central London Older facility but very accommodating staff Good breakfast many restaurant stores 1 2 block away Bathroom was tiny with no fan or ventilation so it got warmish Quite comfy but small rooms Beautiful garden in back Overall a great value for London Would stay here again 
 Breakfast buffet was more than satisfactory Plenty of choices for all Bed was very comfortable Bathroom shower was powerful and plenty of hot water Location could not have been better Very short walk to underground Beautiful gardens at the rear of hotel Very quiet in spite of being close to Earl s Court Rd Staff was friendly and helpful Everyone was very easy to deal with 
 There was a beautiful garden at the back of the property where guests could relax in the sunshine read order a drink etc A great location very close to Earls Court restaurants and tube Good breakfast 
 Fantastic location very clean room someone called Leanne I think on reception was helpful and kind Breakfast was lovely great choice 
 Breakfast was excellent Staff in the restaurant were very pleasant especially the lady who took our room numbers showed us to our table 
 The garden was a bonus Lovely area to have some quiet time and enjoy a drink Secure parking was also a good feature 
 Great location it s easy to find and incredibly close to the Earl s Court Underground station Clean Quiet Breakfast was a good quality and selection Nice pillows Lovely large windows in the rooms with beautiful billowing curtains Newly remodeled marble slate bathroom Mini fridge in room Desk had a mirror so it doubled as a great place to do hair and make up Beautiful garden area I didn t get to spend much time out back but it s worth buying a glass of wine and hanging out with some friends in that area 
 Location first and foremost Lovely gardens 
 Very good hotel professional people s and very well organized Unfortunately the fitness area is veeery small maybe this hotel with this kind of level can evaluate in the best future to invest something more in space for this area Sauna was not available but o k i can accept this in summer period i hope this will not hapen during winter nothing more check always the price sometimes without promotion is not acceptable for this kind of structure I will pay for this not more than 150 p more than this price became not anymore competitive with similar hotel with same level
 Clean comfy beds Beautiful gardens Excellent helpful staff 
 The staff were all so professional and friendly They really made the entire visit special and went out of their way to accommodate every inquiry or request we made The hotel itself was clean and the location to get on the Earl s Court tube was really convenient for all of our planned excursions I would totally recommend the K K Hotel George 
 Small but modern and well furnished room Nice linens and a superior small bathroom 
 Very comfortable bed with two kind of pillows one higher and one lower that suit different need in our family The hotel has a inside garden beautiful English style where you feel relax with a glass of beer It s very close to the Earl s court station but still loated on a quite street you can keep the window open while you sleep during the night We like this hotel 
 Fantastic breakfast buffet Great location Quiet rooms 
 We stay at this hotel each time we are in London in a nice quiet street just a short walk to Earls Court underground station the staff are always friendly rooms are always cleaned properly it s just a nice place to return to after a long day in London Great buffet breakfast
 Great position lovely having breakfast overlooking beautiful garden Which you could have a walk around or seat and relax Staff were very helpful and friendly

 The staff was very helpful
 Hotel was nice and comfortable Very clean Room was a bit small but adequate Staff was friendly and helpful The location was great because it was a 4 minute walk from 2 underground lines Plenty of restaurants convenience stores and ATM nearby 
 We really liked the breakfast There was a wide choice of food The hotel is in a nice neighbourhood with many good quality restaurants It is also close to the subway station 
 Room as advertised excellent location a 2 minute walk to buses and the tube Friendly and helpful front desk staff Would love to stay here on our next London trip too 
 quiet comfy room Very helpful staff Excellent location just off the Earls Court tube and lots of excellent places to eat close by 
 Closeness to Piccadilly Line and general ambience of the hotel
 The location is excellent direct route from the airport at Heathrow The hotel is clean and modern and has basic amenities breakfast room bar The street is quiet A good hotel if travelling on business 
 The staff were superb very helpful and friendly The hotel is in an excellent position close to the Underground station and easy to get to The room was very clean and well serviced each day 
 The location was excellent 2 mins from tube and walkable to several locations Kensington Palace Albert Hall Knightsbridge etc if you re reasonably mobile We received a complimentary upgrade on the room Bed was lovely and comfortable Hotel was lovely Staff friendly and attentive As is just off main road nice and quiet Can t review facilities as we spent all day and night out in the city but what we saw and read it had all you need I always judge things on whether you d return and in this case yes I would You ll probably be able to get cheaper elsewhere but when you walk in you will realise why Lovely hotel for a special occasion 
 We had gluten free breakfast They had separate toaster for gluten free breads But I can not recommend the breakfast or eating there at all for people who need to follow strict gluten free diet Otherwise I can not complain great full wide ranging and diverse breakfast I just could not eat it Still for sure I could stay there for another time and bring my husband for the breakfast Enough for a big man It was great to have opportunity to print out your boarding passes after on line check in before leaving the hotel 
 friendly stuff clean location
 Perfect location close to all transports Nice and clean hotel Friendly staff and a really nice garden The area was nice and quiet 
 I absolutely love this hotel The staff is great the rooms are small but comfortable The location cannot be beat This hotel is a 2 min walk to the tube station and from there you can get anywhere you need to go 
 Location for tube and central London plus some nice restaurants close by too Staff were very pleasant Breakfast was fresh and plentiful choice too 
 Generally it s a wonderful experience The hotel is within walking distance of Earl s court station very convenient location There re cafe bakery fast food supermarket very near to the hotel The staffs at the reception are polite and helpful especially a gentleman The room space is sufficient there s no problem to put two large suitcases The TV is new and major English TV programs are provided Mattress is comfortable it s glad to find water boiler in the room so I can make some tea Complimentary mint chocolate and drinking water are provided The cleanness is excellent no dirty spot is found Bath towels and amenities are changed everyday The surrounding area is safe to hang around during night It costs only around 100 pounds per night which is a good deal 
 The breakfast was perfect very clean parking was easy to reach and available even we left the hotel one night to go to Leeds Very kind of the hotel 
 The location is definitely the main selling point
 Good quality breakfast food friendly and efficient staff

 Location for Central London is perfect Hotel is very clean 
 very good location restaurants and supermarkets around and the clineanliness of the hotel 
 Superfriendly staff comfortable beds safe in the closet and the housekeeping was superb they even made the bed extra nice for my daughter by tucking in her Teddybears 3 Clean bathroom nice shower and the room was nice and quiet for my daughter to sleep in the evening Unfortunately it was winter so we did not get the opportunity to spend time in the garden but it made a nice view from the window in our room and at the breakfast table The underground is only a 2 minute walk so getting around was very easy I am overall very satisfied with my stay at this hotel and would recommend it 
 I especially liked my room s well operating walk in non slip shower and bathroom an amenity not always found in other London hotels I also liked the comfortable bed the size of room the good elevators lifts and the proximity to Earl s Court Tube buses cafes shops and ATMs 
 Thank you K K Hotel George at Earl s Court you assured our stay in London was fun and despite some snow cozy and pleasant Thank you for accommodating our every need from booking theatre tickets to providing cutlery for our take away even letting us borrow the HDMI cable from the business centre Everyone is so knowledgeable and helpful and kind Cannot wait try your other locations thank you again kkhotelgeorge kkhotelgeorge

 The position of the hotel was very close to Earl s Court Tube Station
 The location was perfect Stones through away from Earls Court station Staff were all lovely and accommodating Gardens were lovely Cracking Thai restaurant round the corner too Rooms were fine nothing outstanding but clean and the bed was comfy We didn t use all the hotel facilities unfortunately as really busy sight seeing

 This is the second K K hotel I stayed at the other was in Barcelona It s a great boutique hotel The hotels are spotless staff is extremely friendly and this particular hotel has the most gorgeous back yard although it was a little too cold to sit outside You re in a good neighborhood not in the thick of it all which is nice for London Would definitely stay here again

 Very good location in a quiet street with no bars or noisy passer bys Only a short walk to nearest subway Nice and clean hotel but with relatively small rooms Good service but could benefit from a bit more warmth from he staff Nice breakfast restaurant Will come back again 
 The hotel is incredibly handy to Earl s Court Station We loved using the garden at the rear of the hotel plus its quiet location such a bonus for enjoying a quiet G T at the end of each hectic day in London We ate breakfast daily throughout our stay in the hotel s restaurant and the freshness food quality and choices were excellent Being exhausted one night we ate dinner also in the restaurant where we chose from a limited but ample menu Must mention that we had initial fears of noise from the elevator adjacent to which our room was located There was no need to worry as we never heard a sound from it amazing We ll be using this hotel again as it suited us so well 
 Excellent location You have the access to Earl s Court Underground within 3 minutes walk District and Piccadilly Lines take you to most of the sites you possibly need to go especially Heathrow without any transfer Many stores and restaurants around but the hotel is situated in a quiet quarter 
 House keeping quality and service very good Even folded our clothes Breakfast was unbelievable You even had stewed prunes First floor room was clean comfortable and very quiet Loved the morning newspapers and availability of little lounge for afterdinner coffee and drinks Liked the breakfast being made available with room price Obtaining a cab at desk was very quick and their services the cab was quality also Would consider staying here again 
 Although the rooms are small they are comfortable and cozy and we found the hotel to be a great spot to rest and relax after running around the city Breakfast was included making the price a little more reasonable than many hotels in this very expensive city 
 I love everything about this hotel it s in a perfect location round the corner from the tube but in a quiet street The breakfast caters for all tastes and is plentiful and delicious The rooms and beds are comfortable and very clean the staff can t do enough for you The whole feel of the hotel is up to and excelling in some cases the standard of an expensive West End hotel but with a cosy feel to it It s my favourite hotel in London and I ve stayed in quite a few 
 This is the second time I stay in this hotel It s clean and bed is calling my comfortable Also the vote is near by earls court underground station and the street is full of restaurants coffee shops and supermarkets
 close to city center 3mins away from Tube station very clean and comfortable rooms very friendly and professional staff excellent breakfast
It is the best place that I have stayed so far.
 This hotel was a great value near the tube station in Earl s Court It was one of the few places in London that offered three twin beds in one room which was perfect for us since we were traveling with our daughter It was very clean and charming with comfortable beds and in a lovely quiet neighborhood proximate to transportation to everything There was a nice little lounge bar in the lobby that we stopped into every night after our touring 
 Staff are well mannered and provide high standards of service Breakfast buffet is first rate Easy access to rest of London esp Old Brompton Road and Knotting Hill 
 Location is very useful for Heathrow as taking the tube is safer than taxi if you don t want to miss your flight The place is very clean room size is fine and staff is very good 
 Great location easy transportation to everything Walking distance to restaurants and grocery stores Room was very quiet and comfortable
 The breakfast selections were plentiful and and the attention to service was appreciated We especially liked the orderly way seating at breakfast was handled Great taxi service was provided when requested 
 The beds and decor were nice It was an easy walk from the tube station and there were plenty of food establishments still open around it late at night We chose this hotel because three adults could stay in the one room in three separate beds which is a rare thing to find in accommodation Extra pillows and a toothbrush set were brought promptly on request 
 We had a fantastic stay at the K K George Very easy access to Earls Court tube which goes straight to Heathrow as well as being a great start to explore London easily Quiet street just behind the main shops and a lovely garden to have an evening drink in Room was very comfortable and well serviced Breakfast had lots of choice Really a lovely base for a holiday in London 
 Location Close to some shops and restaurants only 3 minutes walk Underground 4 minutes walk Polite and assistive staff Room space is good
 Excellent location quiet but easy access to transport Quiet room plenty big enough very clean with attractive garden views Very good breakfast Friendly and helpful staff Would be very happy to stay there again 
 Location was excellent as it was very close to Earls Court station and to the main High street Staff were friendly and breakfast was really good We were given the executive room which has direct access to the beautiful garden My whole family loved this hotel and for sure will book it again when I travel to London 
 Great food very nice bar staff
It is the best place that I have stayed so far.

It is the best place that I have stayed so far.
 Location very convenient to tube nice garden area to sit in after a long day breakfast buffet was very nice
 Conveniently placed near tube and bus stations and earl s court high street Very quiet since it s in a back lane Nice view from the fifth floor 
 Like the location as I chose it myself Breakfast is fine and staff very professional and approachable Bed very comfy
 Everything except the space in the room
 The beds were comfortable and the rooms clean and spacious The staff are polite and helpful 
 Great selection for breakfast buffet Hotel location great Near Earls Court tube station Loved the huge garden where you could sit and eat or have a beverage Hotel has a bar high is convenient
 We had a lovely stay at K K the staff was wonderful and so thoughtful When we arrived at 7 30 am after travelling all evening they offered the use of the Wellness Center to take showers amazing fluffy towels and freshen up before we headed out for a day of sightseeing since we would not be able to check in until 3pm That really saved the day and we had an amazing day in London 
 Good range of foods and drinks for the breakfast location is just next to Earl s court station compact but clean equipment fully provided room friendly staffs
 Excellent staff breakfast was great with a good choice Room very comfortable Location is brilliant and there is very little street noise 
 the staff were very helpful with directions and very welcoming The bar area was welcoming as a lone female on business I didn t feel overwhelmed eating drinking there The location to the tube was excellent
 Location is good 2 mins to Earl s Court station Loads of restaurants nearby Tranquil neighbourhood Clean Free printing stable wifi
 Very comfortable beds Very quiet despite facing the street Excellent breakfast Great location Friendly staff Close to good restaurants and pubs 
 Room was basic for the price we paid It was very hot in the room and not very much room in the bathroom Spotlessly clean and good location 
 I love the location and working Wi Fi
 The breakfast was excellent The garden at the back of the hotel was superb the children could run around let off steam whilst we had a drink in the garden The staff were very friendly Excellent location 
 The room was compact but bright and nicely decorated Staff very friendly and helpful Peaceful street but very close to Earl s Court tube Would stay there again
 Good location in Earls court quiet and comfortable 
 the bed was very comfortable and the linens crispy clean we paid 15pounds for the breakfast buffet which was good with fresh fruit eggs were delicious The price for breakfast is a little high I liked the free coffee in the lobby and the free apples service for breakfast excellent with lots of refills and frquent refills on the hot items which were also really hot 
 Perfect location in South West London Very serene and close to the tube station about 250 meters Many restaurants around and nice walk to Hyde Park Very clean and decent place 
 The room was spacious and very clean and the location meant it was incredibly easy for us to get about on the underground 
 Refurbished with lovely granite bathroom and very comfortable beds We had the classic twin which like most London hotels was small but adequate We suggest you book the breakfast included rate as it is a superior buffet Location is great as only a block away from the tube with the Picadilly line leading direct to Covent Garden and the theatres 
It is the best place that I have stayed so far.
 The bed was very comfortable and the bathroom was lovely All very clean 
 The bed was definitely extra comfy slept like a baby The staff was friendly and helpful The printing center was also very convenient 
 Unlike the small hotels around this area this one is large and well organized The location is great which is only 3 munites walk from Earl s Court underground station which means it is in a quiet street but also is so easy to get food around The room is comparatively large considering the size of the hotel rooms in London It only takes about 40 munites going from Heathrow airport to the hotel and is very suitable for people with large suitcases and arrive in London not very early I will definitely prefer this hotel next time 
 Loved the location so easy to access the subway and coffee shops and restuarants
 Great location just round the corner from earls court station Easy access to all main attractions Comfy room Breakfast excellent choice Staff very friendly Would definately stay again on our next trip to London 
 Very helpful staff willing to help Great breakfast and not rushed away as could sit and chat over breakfast Great choice of food in pleasant dining room 
 This is an excellent hotel Location is amazing just minutes from Earl s Court tube station but so quiet you can t believe you are in the centre of the City We could easily walk to Kensington High Street Hyde Park Natural History Museum etc Excellent shower phenomenal water pressure Room was clean Bed was very comfortable Staff excellent very friendly and able to provide lots of recommendations for sights and restaurants Breakfast was very good The hotel restaurant is good too a good alternative if you are back late from a tour or too tired to go out We will be back 
 Good location Parking available although quite expensive Close to subway

 We loved the buffet breakfast and that the staff was so quick to provide us with breakfast bags when we left the hotel to go on tours Very quick responses to opening the windows and unlocking door when we inadvertently left key in room Also appreciated setting up taxi to go to airport 
 Put us next to a smoking room and two of us asmathic Staff were so rude when we brought it up They eventually moved us to a new room which was a massive downgrade and one of us had to sleep on a camp bed No apology was offered 
 Brilliant location Hotel comfortable and clean Staff very friendly and helpful Lovely view over London from our 5th floor room Breakfast excellent Lovely garden Wouldn t hesitate to stay here again and recommend it Very good value for money

 Location
 Excellent location for the price less than 5 mins walking to Earl s Court underground station which has a direct train to the airport on the Piccadilly line good breakfast
 The staff were friendly the meal was nice could not use front entrance like everyone else had to use underground car park and go up hill 20 metres and down 20 metres down its a accident waiting to happen 
 Its central location its proximity to metro station 3 min walk to Earl s Court Underground Station free internet delicious and varied food for breakfast and most importantly the really friendly and helpful staff members were the plus sides
 Everything a boutique hotel should be Well located on a quiet side street 1 minute walk to Earls Court station Tasteful design throughout with great thought to efficency of design Really impressive My single room was quite small but well laid out I WILL go back Liked it the best of 30 hotels I ve stayed in London 
 Staff were indifferent and sullen I was given the impression the guests there were an inconvenience I left two personal items behind after checking out and after ringing on 9 seperate occasions speaking to several staff members and emailing supposed head of housekeeping I got nowhere not once did anyone ring me back even after promising everytime they would and I never heard from them about my items Ever They also gave me a 20 year old folding cot bed with a 1 mattress to sleep on for 3 nights I Would have thought 1000 plus for 3 nights would have afforded me a bed Yes I complained and they relented eventually Although the location is fantasticly placed I would never ever recommend this hotel to anyone in fact stay well away 
It is the best place that I have stayed so far.

 Bar area and Reception good
 We love everything about the Hotel George the location the facilities the staff and as this was our 4th stay in 5 years couldn t stay last year due to illness or it would have been 5 I think that speaks for itself 
 On this occasion the room was larger than on my recent stay which made things more comfortable however the bathroom was tiny The d cor was OK perhaps functional is an apt description There was minimal noise from the street which is a blessing in such a highly populated area and the location adjacent to Earls Court station was ideal 
 I went to London to visit my niece who was studying in London This hotel was ideally located in Earl s Court close to her apartment and the tube station Very nice hotel and staff Nice selection of food at breakfast Located in a very quiet neighborhood but just minutes from the shops and stores at Earl s Court 
 Room was OK if a little small and this was a King Executive Tea coffee making facilities were missing but most importantly it was pretty quiet and comfortable I requested a room change from a shower to a bath which was accommodated 
 Location was great lots of nice pubs and restaurants nearby very close to underground easy to get to from heathrow excellent bed 
 Very quiet area nice to have a room with access to the garden I like the fact that it is a small hotel Plus I like the fact that it was a shower cubicle rather than over the bath shower 
 Excellent location close to station location has parking which is very important
 Location staff and cleanliness 
 Great breakfast all the usual items just higher quality plus cava and nice touches like Austrian apple strudel 
 Good staff comfortable bed and pillows although we were a little disappointed at the size of the executive bedroom Excellent choice of food at breakfast The bar area is a relaxing place to sit and have a drink with friends or just to sit quietly by the warm fire

 Location near Earls Court underground was great Newspapers and TV stations were good View of gardens was nice lots of choices in the buffet nice to have a mini fridge in the small room 
 There was little or nothing wrong with this excellent hotel Our room was very comfortable and a good size for a London hotel It was clean tidy and well equipped The staff were first class They were polite helpful and did it all with a smile which meant a lot The breakfast menu was comprehensive and of good quality We will certainly pay a return visit

 Just returned from a wonderful weekend at the apex temple court Where to start From the amazing upgrade for my husbands 30th birthday to the personalised handwritten note and chocolates left for us in the room everything was perfect from the start The hotel is in a great location less than 10 minutes walk to Covent Garden and for location alone is great value I had chosen the hotel as we were attending the aldwych theatre and it was literally around the corner It s clean modern and our room was to die for with a balcony offering views of the London eye The apex offers so many extra touches with the free jelly beans Pringles and of course the apex duck We had a great nespresso machine in our room and robes and slippers all added to make the perfect stay They really have thought about everything We have stayed in many hotels in London but would definately choose apex again 
 It was located in a cosy corner off the street

 Rooms are quiet Beds are huge Bathroom is spacious and shower is hot and powerful Location is very good Thames within walking distance Temple area is beautiful Note however that during weekends the atmosphere is different than during week days due to the fact that many shops most of the business centres and the criminal courts are closed which results in less people in the neighbourhoud 
 Comfortable room which was very clean
It is the best place that I have stayed so far.
 Everything from the reception greeting of Luca to leaving wth yet another warm vibe from reception The cleaning staff were polite and warm My standard room was spotless in terms of cleanliness an incredibly cosy bed a nice ambience to the room 
 Very comfortable and clean room Balcony was a little plus 
 Alex Hotel couldn t find our booking at first but it worked out that they had upgraded us to a Junior suite which was amazing Free rubber duck was a nice touch and did make us laugh 
 Hotel was clean smart looking and great location as well as very professional The room was spacious and the bathroom with both separate shower and bath was a brilliant bonus Our room was located right outside the lifts and we didnt hear anything Also had to love the Apex duck Would definately recommend staying in an Apex hotel 
 location would have been great
 Room was a nice size and very quiet Quite a long walk from reception along winding corridors but worth the walk when you got there We were in room 149 which was the very end room on a corridor and we never heard a thing 
 The hotel is in a quiet location right in the heart of London so it is within easy walking distance of most of the places we wished to visit We didn t experience the usual problem of banging doors and loud voices that seems to be the norm these days in big hotels maybe because we were right at the end of a corridor maybe because the walls and floors are well soundproofed so we managed to have a good undisturbed night s sleep There was very little traffic noise either It was lovely to be able to go to the local theatres and walk back to the hotel afterwards The Novello is a about 10 minutes walk away I loved the idea of the little duck it made it feel more personal and now sits in my bathroom at home The room we had was a good size the bed was extremely comfortable and the room was spotlessly clean A bath robe and slippers were provided as well as the usual toiletries 
 Location of the hotel
 Really lovely and luxurious hotel Special thanks to Gosia on Reception who went above and beyond to make our stay as enjoyable and special as possible so thank you Gosia 
 The room was really completely sound proof We appreciated the bathroom with both tube and big shower cabin together with the super cozy bath ropes And if you like to listen to music properly don t forget to bring a little audio cable jack to jack The superior rooms are equipped with a Bose sound system but it doesn t have a bluethooth connection and you will need this cable 
 Excellent location good standard of hotel Professional service
It is the best place that I have stayed so far.
 Location was reason for booking and was spot on Staff were all very pleasant Time was spent out and about as we were visiting friends and family so didn t use facilities or eat breakfast Room was clean and tidy with great black out curtains Check out swift and easy 
 Location of the hotel is fantastic The hotel itself has a lovely atmosphere and the staff are very helpful The room was massive particularly considering its location in London The breakfast had a great selection and was perfect to prepare for a long day walking around London 
 Great hotel in good location fairly near theatres St Paul s Tate Modern The City River Thames The Shard half hour walk to Trafalgar Square a bit more to Soho Oxford St Nice to walk along the river to Westminster or get a boat 10 15min taxi from St Pancras Fairly quiet district for London but not much happening in the immediate location

 The size of the room
 Nothing special
 The front desk and entrance was very nice and the staff were helpful 
 they transfer me to The Park Grand London Kensington due to maintance work at The Park Grand London Paddington they offer me a free ride to Kensington a soft drink while im i watting the taxi and includ the breakfast in my stay which that im not applied for it Park Grand London Kensington newer and bigger than Park Grand London Paddington Underground station 3 mins walk People at reception and generally everyone I interacted with was super friendly and helpful which makes a difference the handy phone that comes with the room The bathroom is clean with all required supplies There is a microwave and small separate room for cloths and iron 
 This is my second time staying at this Hotel The first time I was on business This time it was for mini holiday The bed is very comfortable The room and bathroom very clean and spacious The location is very convenient Very good selection at breakfast 
 Very handy location to Paddington Station and Heathrow Express and in the pretty Paddington area This hotel is clean and comfortable if a little dated The staff are wonderful thank you And the English breakfast was excellent Not a fancy and extensive breakfast buffet but a tasty and well cooked meal Equally food on the room service menu was tasty and fresh Good Indian and European cuisine 
 The room was small but we knew that before arrival I just didn t think that paying an extra 40 for a room that I wasn t going to spend much time in warranted it The wardrobe didn t mark sense as it was so thin you couldn t actually hang anything in it The hairdryer was in the wardrobe and the mirror on the back of the door that didn t open wide enough to look in to blow dry your hair Parking was a nightmare as you have to park 10 minutes away and trudge back with your luggage This wasn t mentioned before booking I wish the hotel would have had a link to booking which is under Waitrose and was 40 for two night The price wasn t that bad it was just the nightmare of walking back and forth with luggage The location was good close to Paddington and Lancaster Gate we walked to oxford street as it was so close and the weather was fab 
 The free breakfast every morning that came with the stay The staff in the restaurant were wonderful 
 Hyde Park and public transport are in close proximity we used Bayswater station everyday Staff is really helpful supported us in printing boarding passes The pub across the street is great The room is small but probably good for value because of price and location 
 The drinks at the bar were very reasonably priced
 Great transport system nearby especially from the airport LHR Customer service is excellent
 Location shower
 Good Aircon Comfy bed Brilliant shower
 Good shower and toiletries Air conditioning Big window and pleasant outlook Towels and sheets clean and good quality Apples available at reception Iron available from reception desk 
 Good location Staff was good 
 location not too bad access to tube and rail confusing with another hotel in group within close proximity went to book into wrong hotel interior bit tired and then we were in the room at the top of the building so bit dark Bathroom facilities strange with wet room set up but not ideal with curtain and door so close 
 The space is good for a family of 4 The bathroom is clean with all required supplies There is a microwave and small separate room for cloths and iron 
 The hotel location is excellent It is super close to the Paddington train and tube stations It is near to places to eat food stores and pharmacy You walk three streets south and you are next to the Hyde Park Kensington Gardens gate I had breakfast at their restaurant two days in a row and the food was good and a good selection of items My room did not have an iron and ironing board in it but it was made available by the staff right away 
 Very friendly helpful staff Room was cleaned well Beautiful building in a quiet area of Paddington with good facilities nearby
 The room was very modern and clean Staff were also very friendly and made our stay extra special 
 Convenient location very clean and modern good coffee helpful staff
 The location was perfect
 I expected a budget room to be small but this really was v small cramped Not enough space for suitcase shower area adequate Hidden wardrobe drop down desk useful Bed however very comfortable indeed Staff exceptionally helpful which made up for the minute sized room 
 Rooms way to small bathrooms also small 
 Quiet pleasant location a few minutes walk from Paddington station Good sized room and bathroom 
It is the best place that I have stayed so far.
 A great hotel in a beautiful old terrace building We had a club room which was modern and spacious with large windows Bed was amazingly comfortable Walking distance to Paddngton Station and Heathrow Express 
 Very helpful and accomodating staff Lovely to have a valet to carry my bag to and from my room and get me a cab The concierge desk was very helpful Was given free breakfast each day after having to be moved to their sister hotel just a short distance down the street due to a broken boiler in my booked hotel 
 Short walk from Kensington Gardens and Paddington Station Lots of coffee shops and restaurants in the vicinity Helpful friendly staff at reception Especially the lady from Armenia Was first put into a small rooftop room but then given a bigger room on lower floor with huge ceilings 
It is the best place that I have stayed so far.
 Good location within 10 minutes walk of Paddington Quiet location with great facilities and pleasant staff Easy access to travel points and only 5 minutes from Kensington Gardens 
 I booked a triple room The room is quiet large and has a balcony The location is really nice Near the paddinton station just about 5 minutes walk and hyde park The staff are very very friendly and they will try to meet all your need I order two room services and the food is really delicious breakfast is also very nice I will definitely choose this hotel again when I go to London next time 
 The friendliness of the staff was exceptional They wanted our visit to be the best and my daughter who was 6 months pregnant received special treatment Breakfast was very good 
 The bed is super comfortable I could close the curtains and make it very dark make tea in the morning in teapot there And of course it is very clean 
 A compact but well furnished room with a very comfortable bed good lights and an excellent shower 
 A nice hotel in a very convenient location Very clean People at reception and generally everyone I interacted with was super friendly and helpful which makes a difference I also appreciated the welcome plate of fruits as well as the handy phone that comes with the room Very convenient especially when your own phone is behaving weird in other countries All this made up for the price which I initally thought a bit too much and I still booked an offer that was supposed to be largely discounted 120 a night for a compact room If I paid the full amount I would think it is overpriced but I guess that s London in the summer 
 The club room is comfortable for 2 Clean and bright The room seems to be newly furbished The toilet is spacious too 
 OMG What a tiny tiny room You could not walk around the bed without walking sideways No room for anything No barfridge Appalling really when they tout themselves as being boutique 
It is the best place that I have stayed so far.
 The staff were friendly and polite The location was ideal for commuting in and out of the centre of London easily There were ample places to go for a meal within walking distance 
 the hotel was close to the underground and some nice resturants
 The rooms have been renovated to look quite nice and are representative of the photos but they re not at all functional to stay in They ve placed extra furniture items in the room in an attempt to correct this but that just makes the spaces cluttered and not all of the additional items are functional either i e additional robe placed in dark entrance mostly filled up by the ironing board hard to see into damp smell emanating from it and makes accessing room awkward I ended up checking out after one night as I was there for 5 days and had work commitments so ease of use with the room was important to me 
 The room was huge and very quiet
 A mostly very young staff were very helpful and added to the stay 
 Staff in Restaurant were very helpful at Breakfast with Gluten Free Diet Selection of food was very good 
 Friendly staff and easy to walk to the tube clean rooms
 We actually stayed at Grand Royal Hyde Park as there was a problem with the boiler at Paddington one To make up for transfer they gave us free drinks while we waited for the taxi they gave us and gave us free breakfasts at the Hyde Park It was a beautiful hotel ornate turned wood stained glass windows beautiful painted ceilings like being in Rome the staff were polite happy to help and give us information looked after our bag on checkout day until we left London at 7pm Breakfast was in a beautiful large room plentiful full cooked or continental fresh croissants anything you could possibly want The room was very comfortable complete with kettle and fridge and wardrobe View wasn t great overlooked an alley but it was light and quiet no street noise All manner of shops and cafes and the tube just around the corner And Hyde park 50 metres away I would definitely recommend this to others 
 Paddington is a beautiful suburb and unbelievably quiet for London Rooms are a reasonable size for London and the window could actually be opened which makes a nice change Complimentary fruit water was also a nice touch Definitely would return to this hotel

 very comfortable room and excellent staff They welcomed us at the hotel with smiles and upgraded our room to a club room for the night for no extra money we ordered room service and the food was absolutely amazing with no exceptions we had salad soup and two main courses all of which we couldnt finish because of the plentiful portions It was not expensive either I am definitely planning on staying at this hotel again or one of others in their chain of hotels Theres plenty of room to keep clothes in built in closets and the shower is great as well Overall an excellent and cozy experience

 Location of hotel
 Enjoyed our stay here it was nice and clean the staff were very friendly Great hospitality would definitely recommend this to family and friends The location is great too easy to get around to other tourist attractions parks shopping places 
 Adequate for our needs Breakfast was good 
 Very clean and tidy modern room bed was comfortable staff were friendly great location under 10 minute walk to Paddington station first time to London and would return to this hotel 
 Club room type was really nice Thanks to the staff for upgrading our booking after no room available of our own pick at our arrival Really quiet area Two different Tube stations to choose from at a 5 7min walk distance Friendly and helpful staff 
 The hotel overbooked tried to palm me off to an inferior hotel This wasted 2 hours of my time which caused me to change my dinner plans Not a good start 
 The hotel is very clean The double bed was very small It is a bad and a half in a double luxury room Room had micro fridge and tea coffe but it is a very small room
 Situation of hotel was in a quiet area Location was not the closest to Paddington Station for Heathrow Express but it was still within reasonable walking distance The staff in the lobby were excellent and very customer oriented 
 The staff were excellent particularly the Night Manager who handled a breakdown in our bathroom really well in the end relocating us to a different hotel with the same chain and providing complimentary airport transfers Very pleased with the service 
 Acceptable room
 During a rare London Heat Wave in July the air conditioning EXCEPTIONALLY good Newly renovated rooms with spa bathrooms Breakfast was the best offering we had 
 I had a very good stay here with my young children we had a lovely good sized room not small staff are very friendly Would recommend this hotel to families 
 The Italian restaurant up the street from the hotel which we had to use as the hotel restaurant bar and room service all closed by the time we checked in at 10 30 
 I can recommend this hotel friendly staff comfortable beds and a nicer location in a very quiet area lots nice restaurants nearby close to Lancaster gate tube station or Paddington station where the Heathrow express arrives bike hire outside you can ride around Hyde Park the hop on hop off bus passes nearby which we found a great way to get around the breakfast was exceptionally good
 Overall staff were excellent Quality of food was superior to most hotel restaurants with good price points Wraps etc freshly prepared so able to accommodate changes Room service curry very good Handy phone was an unexpected bonus as it included free calls to the USA allowing me to resolve issues with AT T not properly applying international adjustments Room had excellent soundproofing and air conditioning especially in this heat wave Bed very comfortable and bedding great Reception staff very helpful graciously coordinated an early check in Shower was awesome with superb water pressure and nice no water shortage compared to US so no need to recycle towels etc House keeping did a great job too The door staff could not do enough to assist guests very attentive and friendly
